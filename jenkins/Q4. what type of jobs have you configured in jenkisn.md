# Q4. what type of jobs have you configured in jenkisn ?
Ans :

There are many job types in jenkins if we are not getting job options then we need to install plugin like pipeline , multibranch pipeline , folder, freestyle job etc. to configure the job .


configuring the job depends on requirements a freestyle job is a simplest type of job, we configure a pipeline which have CI and CD steps , i have also configured multibranch pipeline where we scan the branches and perform required steps to build , test and deploy or whatever is the perpose of particular branch.

pipeline is more configurable we can definde the pipeline in groovy , it can have basic steps such as build test and deploy and whatever we need we can add such as notification or  email , but we need to make sure whenever we are adding the stage the required plugin should be installed.

the pipeline jobs can be versioned in github , since it is a code we  need to follow the best practices i.e should not store username and passwords as a text , we should store in any vault , hard coding should be avoided , and we should make the pipeline code reusable.
